# level09
We are greeted with an executable called `level09` and a file called `token`.  
`token` is owned by `flag09`, but is not accessible in any way for `flag09`, and only and has read permission for both group `level09` and others.  
`level09` is also owned by `flag09` but has its GID set to group `level09` and permissions of `rws r-s r-x`.
